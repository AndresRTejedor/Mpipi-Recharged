### Potential of Mean Force simulations
In this folder, you will find the scripts and files necessary to run a batch of umbrella sampling simulations of a sample amino-acid pair.
A sample of the outputs you will be able to create throughout the preparation process and after the simulation are also included for reference.

**Note**: To run these simulations, you will need to have GROMACS installed both in your local machine and your HPC cluster. The simulations in the paper are carried out with GROMACS 2019.3 Compiled with Clang.

You will also need a copy of the force field Amber03ws available here: https://github.com/bestlab/force_fields/tree/master/gromacs_format/amber03ws.ff
